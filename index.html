<p>This past summer (Summer 2014), after my Sophomore Year in college at Loyola University Chicago, I decided to stay in Chicago for the summer. As I am from Northern California, this was a big and exciting step for me. Living in the city over the summer, I was promised, would be a great, sunshiney time to attend music festivals, relax, and explore the city during some of the only hospitable months Chicago offers. While all of this ended up being absolutely true and a great, sunshine-and-festival-filled-summer was had, another thing Chicago had to offer stood out to me in a powerful way. John was the Streetwise magazine vendor down the street from my summer apartment. I passed by him every day as I embarked on my escapades in urban exploration, and I got to know him pretty well on a friendly, casual level. He was a great guy. He told bad jokes, just the way I like them, and genuinely loved talking with people and being a bright part of the Rogers Park community. The magazines he sold were interesting forays into local politics and social justice issues, and I loved coming home to read them in my tiny apartment. One thing that often dampened my days, however, was that more than a few times I did not have any cash on me to pay for John's Streetwise magazines. I often turned to buying John a cup of coffee or a scone from local coffee shops, but it wasn't enough. The problem I saw surely affected more people than just myself.  </p>

<p>I thought about this a lot as my summer progressed, and eventually came up with the idealistic idea to do something about it. At the time, though, I didn't have enough confidence in my own software development abilities to immediately tackle the problem, so I did my research. Streetwise already had a system to allow for people, like myself, to pay for magazines from their mobile phones. The thing about it was that it was terrible. Apparently PayPal had offered their help creating a web API for allowing people to pay Streetwise vendors individually by typing a long URL into their mobile browsers. The documentation Streetwise had on the process was tedious and poorly written, and half the times I tried accessing their website to read about it, there were page errors and such slowness on their end that I couldn't imagine using the system in place to buy a $2 magazine from my friend John.  </p>

<p>Let's flash-forward a few months and a half a semester. I had become heavily involved with LuTec, the Loyola University Technology Entrepreneurship Cooperative. I loved the people I worked with, and being a part of the group helped me hone my own software development skills and sharpen my enthusiasm for doing work in the field that had the potential to do some real good. At the end of the first semester of my Junior Year at Loyola, after having taken COMP 313, Intermediate Object-Oriented Development with Android, I shot an email to Streetwise's contact address, explaining that I was a young developer looking to get some work under my belt, and that I loved their organization and would love to develop an app to improve their mobile payment experience, free of charge to them. I got a response quickly and as met with a great deal of enthusiasm. The wonderful people at Streetwise wanted to meet as soon as possible to discuss specifics. As I would soon come to find out, they did not have much help to get done what needed doing, having a small staff of 10 or so professionals, and a few more than that in interns. Being a non-profit magazine, a double-hitter in terms of budget-size and need for contemporary technology, Streetwise had been looking to make their organization more robust technologically for a while. My email had come at a great time. My advisor and mentor, Dr. George Thiruvathukal attended the meeting and was super jazzed about the project coming out of it. He jumped at the idea of me using development of the Streetwise app as independent study, as it presented one of the first opportunities for LuTec to do meaningful work outside of the scope of campus. The next semester was spent in correspondence with an interim director for Streetwise and their lead graphic designer to find out exactly what they wanted out of an app, and was a rewarding experience learning the ins and outs of developing software for the real world, specifically in the realm of non-profits.  </p>

<p>The development of the Streetwise app can best be described as a learning experience. I started the development process by first reflecting on my own skills - about what I could best bring to the table for Streetwise to make them the best app possible, while also developing my skills as a software developer and learning as much as possible along the way.  </p>

<p>As I said before, I had just taken a class called Intermediate Object-Oriented Development where we had worked primarily with Android. I was interested in mobile development in general, but something about Android development in particular peaked my interest. The Android platform made more sense to me than iOS's confusing use of Objective-C. While XCode is tightly designed and a very beautiful application, writing apps in Java, using Google's robust Android API clicked for me. I thus decided to develop the initial Streetwise app for Android. I felt that developing for Android would allow me to build a tightly designed initial version of the app that could eventually be expanded as an iOS app, possibly over the summer of 2015 when I would again be living in the city. Next, I decided which version of Android to target. I first chose 2.2 Froyo, which seemed like a good choice because of its wide spread, being compatible with over 90% of active devices, but I ultimately decided to target 3.1 Honeycomb, which allowed me to bypass some bugs I encountered later working with Android's WebView, while still maintaining over 90% compatibility with active devices on the Google Play Store. I then outlined what exactly my app would do, going off of discussions I had been having over the course of the semester with Streetwise. Since Streetwise already had an API and infrastructure set up with PayPal, I decided that the first version of the app, v1.0, would use Android's WebView to display this system. I would, however, take the tedium of users having to make API calls to PayPal's system out of the process by parsing the desired Vendor ID number, a 4-digit code, into a pre-set URL that would then be passed to a WebView activity. Additionally, I wanted to showcase as much of Streetwise's website and social media as possible, so I also decided to incorporate them into the app using a similar WebView setup. Users could click through Streetwise's website and blog, and be directed to their Facebook and Twitter feeds by pressing on-screen icons. I would then try to package all of this in as attractive an app as I could design on my own, promising the Streetwise team to enlist the help of LuTec's graphic design-inclined members in the future.  </p>

<p>With all of the features I wanted in the app outlined, I set about writing the app from scratch using Android Studio. The writing of the app itself was relatively smooth. I ran into a few problems working with WebView, as making requests to web-pages required very specific addressing, as WebView's do not by default do any error-handling or display webpage errors of any kind (i.e., I spent 10 hours or so frantically thinking WebView simply did not work, when all I had to do was connect to "<a href="http://streetwise.org">http://streetwise.org</a>" rather than "www.streetwise.org", no documentation or StackOverflow help surrounding which I could find, until I stumbled upon the solution myself through trial and error). After the initial coding was complete, I created an attractive user interface (by my standards) using photography I had taken my Freshman year of the city of Chicago with some Photoshop flair courtesy of my very-creative girlfriend.  </p>

<p>After extensive physical testing on one of LuTec's Nexus 7's, I was ready to present Streetwise Android to Streetwise themselves. I arranged a final meeting of the semester with the Streetwise crew, and made a final version of the app ready on my testing device to show them. At the meeting, Streetwise loved the app. They agreed to design an app icon based on their organization's design-standards, as well as helping me create images that could scale to more devices than the Nexus 7 I had been testing on, and excitedly urged me to release the app as soon as possible on the Google Play Store. I agreed to do as much. I also asked them something I had been mulling over for the weeks preceding my final meeting with them - if it would be okay by them for me to release the app, under LuTec's name, as an open source project with the MIT license. I thought the app would be perfect as a simple platform for other, similar organizations to adapt to their own purposes and hopefully get some use out of. After all, the issue I had found that past summer getting to know my local vendor John definitely did not affect just me - it had to be a national and international issue facing street newspapers. The Streetwise team thought open source was a great idea, and agreed to promote the app at an upcoming Non-Profit Street Newspaper convention in Seattle in June of 2015. They mentioned a number of organizations similar to Streetwise in Madison, Wisconsin and New York City that they thought could use an app like the one I wrote for them.  </p>

<p>Streetwise Android will be released in the next few weeks on the Google Play Store (the date of this writing is April 22, 2015). My hope is that my code helps Streetwise vendors make sales that they otherwise would have lost to people who simply forgot to bring cash with them, and that organizations similar to Streetwise find a use for the code I wrote. I also plan to spend this coming summer developing the app further, adding more functionality to display content from their social media outlets and website in the app, and to eventually implement an in-app-payment system completely independent from the still-a-bit-tedious PayPal system that my app currently helps make a bit less tedious. This past semester has been an excellent exercise in software development that does some real work toward the betterment of truly remarkable non-profit organizations that otherwise would not have the means to have apps developed for their purposes. The fact that I was able to make all my work open-source makes me even more excited about the future of the app, and has grown my enthusiasm for the field of software engineering as a whole, as I see and feel now the real benefits our field can bring to the world.  </p>
