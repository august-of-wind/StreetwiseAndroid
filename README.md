StreetWise mobile payment application designed by August Meyer on behalf of LuTec. This is an app I designed 
pro-bono for Streetwise Chicago, a really cool non-profit in my city. Streetwise is an organization that connects 
individuals at risk of homelessness with jobs selling magazines. My app lets Streetwise vendors take payments from 
mobile phones! I am releasing this code open source under the MIT license - if anyone out there would like to adapt
this to their own organization, I would love that, and be more than happy to help out however much I can with the 
process. Later updates will include content display from Streetwise blog and other website content.
