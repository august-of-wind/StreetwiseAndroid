{"name":"StreetwiseAndroid","tagline":"An Effort to Bring Technology to Cool Non-Profits","body":"# Streetwise and Me: Some Background on Why I Decided to Make This App, and Why This is Such a Cool Organization \r\n\r\nThis past summer (Summer 2014), after my Sophomore Year in college at Loyola University Chicago, I decided to stay in Chicago for the summer. As I am from Northern California, this was a big and exciting step for me. Living in the city over the summer, I was promised, would be a great, sunshiney time to attend music festivals, relax, and explore the city during some of the only hospitable months Chicago offers. While all of this ended up being absolutely true and a great, sunshine-and-festival-filled-summer was had, another thing Chicago had to offer stood out to me in a powerful way. John was the Streetwise magazine vendor down the street from my summer apartment. I passed by him every day as I embarked on my escapades in urban exploration, and I got to know him pretty well on a friendly, casual level. He was a great guy. He told bad jokes, just the way I like them, and genuinely loved talking with people and being a bright part of the Rogers Park community. The magazines he sold were interesting forays into local politics and social justice issues, and I loved coming home to read them in my tiny apartment. One thing that often dampened my days, however, was that more than a few times I did not have any cash on me to pay for John's Streetwise magazines. I often turned to buying John a cup of coffee or a scone from local coffee shops, but it wasn't enough. The problem I saw surely affected more people than just myself.  \r\n\r\nI thought about this a lot as my summer progressed, and eventually came up with the idealistic idea to do something about it. At the time, though, I didn't have enough confidence in my own software development abilities to immediately tackle the problem, so I did my research. Streetwise already had a system to allow for people, like myself, to pay for magazines from their mobile phones. The thing about it was that it was terrible. Apparently PayPal had offered their help creating a web API for allowing people to pay Streetwise vendors individually by typing a long URL into their mobile browsers. The documentation Streetwise had on the process was tedious and poorly written, and half the times I tried accessing their website to read about it, there were page errors and such slowness on their end that I couldn't imagine using the system in place to buy a $2 magazine from my friend John.  \r\n\r\nLet's flash-forward a few months and a half a semester. I had become heavily involved with LuTec, the Loyola University Technology Entrepreneurship Cooperative. I loved the people I worked with, and being a part of the group helped me hone my own software development skills and sharpen my enthusiasm for doing work in the field that had the potential to do some real good. At the end of the first semester of my Junior Year at Loyola, after having taken COMP 313, Intermediate Object-Oriented Development with Android, I shot an email to Streetwise's contact address, explaining that I was a young developer looking to get some work under my belt, and that I loved their organization and would love to develop an app to improve their mobile payment experience, free of charge to them. I got a response quickly and as met with a great deal of enthusiasm. The wonderful people at Streetwise wanted to meet as soon as possible to discuss specifics. As I would soon come to find out, they did not have much help to get done what needed doing, having a small staff of 10 or so professionals, and a few more than that in interns. Being a non-profit magazine, a double-hitter in terms of budget-size and need for contemporary technology, Streetwise had been looking to make their organization more robust technologically for a while. My email had come at a great time. My advisor and mentor, Dr. George Thiruvathukal attended the meeting and was super jazzed about the project coming out of it. He jumped at the idea of me using development of the Streetwise app as independent study, as it presented one of the first opportunities for LuTec to do meaningful work outside of the scope of campus. The next semester was spent in correspondence with an interim director for Streetwise and their lead graphic designer to find out exactly what they wanted out of an app, and was a rewarding experience learning the ins and outs of developing software for the real world, specifically in the realm of non-profits.  \r\n\r\n# Development of Streetwise Android  ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
